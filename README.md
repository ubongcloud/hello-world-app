# Hello, World! Docker Image

This is a simple Docker image that runs a "Hello, World!" web server using Python.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you build and run the Docker image on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `hello-world-app` directory.

3. Build the Docker image using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker build -t hello-world-image .
   ```

### Running the Docker Container

1. After successfully building the Docker image, you can run the container using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-world-image
   ```

2. The container will start, and the "Hello, World!" web server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

### Stopping the Container

To stop the running container, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it's running.
